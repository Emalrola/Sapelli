 Compression tests results (summer 2013, by mstevens)
------------------------------------------------------

Using SMS transmissions received upto June.

GZIP result is always exactly 18 bytes bigger than DEFLATE because GZIP _is_ DEFLATE but adds a 10-byte header and an 8-byte footer.

When NONE is best (i.e. none of the compressors have a positive effect) then:
 - DEFLATE result is 0 (4%), 1 (5%), 2 (34%), 3 (44%) or 5 (13%) bytes bigger than non-compressed data (% of tested cases)
 - LZMA2 result is always 4 bytes bigger than non-compressed data
 - LZMA2 is always betten than LZMA (LZMA result is between 3 & 12 bytes bigger)
 --> LZMA2 seems to have a built-in mechanism to deal with non-compessable data, which is probably just stored as is, with the addition of a 4-byte "uncompressed" marker

When the data _can_ be compressed (i.e. best is not NONE):
 - BZIP2 performs terrible (don't know why)
 - DEFLATE works better than LZMA/LZMA2 when payloads are small (< +/-290 bytes), LZMA(2) outperforms it for bigger payloads
 - LZMA2 is never best overall
 	- LZMA2 outperforms LZMA in some cases (in which DEFLATE is best), but then the difference between NONE and LZMA2 is always 4 bytes
   		--> This means the data was just not LZMA/LZMA2-compressable and LZMA2 falls back on the "uncompressed" header, while LZMA has no such trick
 	- when LZMA performs better than NONE (i.e. the data _is_ LZMA/LMZA2-compressable), LZMA2 is always 1 or 2 bytes bigger 
   --> LZMA2 has an overhead of 1-2 bytes over LZMA in cases it can compress the data
 
Conclusion on LZMA/LZMA2: There's no point in keeping LZMA2 support
	Because:
 	- LZMA always outperforms LZMA2 when the data is LZMA/LZMA2-compressable.
 	- when the data is not (LZMA/LZMA2-)compressable we have our own "uncompressed" flag mechism which is more efficient than LZMA2 (2 bits vs. 4 bytes)
 	
Overall conclusion:
	We should support: NONE, DEFLATE & LZMA.
	This requires a 2-bit compression mode flag. Leaving room for a possible forth compression mode to be added later.
 
 	Flag values:
 		00 : NONE (= uncompressed)
		01 : DEFLATE
 		10 : LZMA
 		11 : ?
